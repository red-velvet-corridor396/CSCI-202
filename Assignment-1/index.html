                <p>My earliest memories of heavy metal were from car rides with my mom. I don't consider
                    this time
                    period "the beginning" of my interest in metal; rather, I see it as just the context in which my
                    interest was allowed to take root. But it shows that even early on, I had a particular fondness of
                    metal. I've always been drawn to it. My mom and younger brother all listened to music on my parents'
                    iPod (which is ancient, by the way--one of the older models). The music varied a fair amount, but it
                    was mostly popular music (rock, hip-hop/rap, pop, etc.) from the 70's to the 2000's (but mostly the
                    90's and 2000's). And of course, what Gen Xer's library would be complete without Metallica?
                    Specifically, it was the "Garage Inc." compilation that found its way into our rotation. As soon as
                    I heard Metallica's cover of the Queen track "Stone Cold Crazy," I was hooked. (I also I had no idea
                    it was a cover until much, much later.)</p>

                <img class="img left" src="images/ipod.jpg" alt="">

                <p>Sometimes, as a treat, my mom would let the next track, "So
                    What?" play next, and I got to hear the opening "SO FUCKING WHAT!" in all of its obscene glory.
                    (Note: I was no older than 10 or 11.) At that age I didn't quite have the vocabulary to say I liked
                    distorted guitars and dudes with long, greasy hair shouting about things, so I dubbed this genre
                    "angry music." If I wanted to listen to Metallica, I would ask my mom to put on some "angry music."
                    Interestingly, I don't recall hearing any other Metallica songs, or any other thrash bands for that
                    matter, and at one point my mom opted instead to introduce me to Fiona Apple. Her music was
                    certainly angry, but not quite what I was after. I still liked "Fast As You Can" though.</p>

                <p> Fast forward to around 2019. I've only just started to actually listen to music on my own and
                    develop my own taste. At the time, my primary vehicle of music discovery was....."meme song"
                    compilations on YouTube. These videos have long since been DMCA'd, but they introduced me to such
                    classics as "Stayin' Alive" by The Bee Gees, or "Rasputin" by Boney M. I also found a lot of music
                    from movies/TV shows (especially South Park, actually) and video games, and my rotation inherited
                    some artists from my parents' iPod as well (namely, Gorillaz). At this point I spent quite a lot of
                    time online, in groups brought together by particular fandoms (for me, this started in about 2016).
                    In one of these groups, I befriended a guy named Brandon, and he put me onto Korn's "The Path of
                    Totality."</p>
                <p>And so my nu metal phase began. I listened to a fair amount of EDM at the time, so the
                    dubstep elements appealed to me, and, being Korn and all, the album spoke to my overblown teen
                    angst. In due
                    time, I explored other records from Korn's discography, as well as bands like Marilyn Manson, Limp
                    Bizkit, System of a Down, and a handful of songs from Disturbed and Slipknot. I also checked out
                    "Kill 'Em All," "Ride the Lightning," and "Master of Puppets" around this time. Sometime in 2020, I
                    watched South Park Season 21 Episode 6, "Sons a Witches," and one scene in particular featured the
                    classic Iron Maiden track, "The Number of the Beast." I loved it. Shortly after, I checked out some
                    other Iron Maiden songs on my own, and "Fear of the Dark" also became a favorite track of mine.
                    There are a few reasons I consider this era as merely preliminary to my interest in metal: none of
                    these nu metal bands (nor Metallica or Iron Maiden) are the bands that spurred me to sincerely
                    explore metal as a whole, and the rest of my interest in metal has been fairly continuous, while
                    these two eras are more separated, and their consequences on my music taste as a whole aren't as
                    obvious.</p>

                <p>For my senior year of high school, I transferred to another high school in a nearby town (and across the state border!) looking for a fresh start and better educational opportunities. For the most part, I got those things, but I got another very important thing from my tenure at TDHS. It was there that I let metal into my heart. Sorry, Jesus, you'll have to wait in line. It was fall 2022 now, and my music taste had certainly come a long way in the last 5 years. At this time I frequented 4chan's music board, /mu/, and I found a lot of great music via the Essential Charts on 4chan's music wiki and RateYourMusic.com. The former especially would be highly instrumental in helping me get into metal. As soon as I found something I liked, and that I wanted more of, I could simply check those charts and find more right away. That made it easy for me to find a handful of bands I liked rather than just the one. And I could do this quickly. My only real limitation was the rate at which I actually do listen to new music; I tend to do it rather slowly, especially now that the dust has settled and the excitement of an entire genre being new to me has subsided.</p>
                <p class="clear">So, how did this actually start? I struggle a lot to make friends, so around October I asked my mom for some advice, and she suggested complimenting people's shirts (assuming the shirts are of something that I also like, obviously). Not long after, I got the chance to do just that. In my Spanish class I was seated at a table with a guy named Oliver, and eventually I saw him wearing a System of a Down shirt. If I recall, I actually didn't say anything about it the first time. Either I didn't get the chance or I was too shy--likely some combination of both. So I waited a while for him to show up wearing the shirt again. It took a while, but eventually he did, and I told him it was a cool shirt. We may have talked briefly and then parted ways, but I believe we actually became friends when he handed me a note after class at a later date. It had some contact information that I used to hit him up later, and on October 28th, I made my first friend at TDHS. The exact date isn't important, but I'm including it for posterity because I went through a lot of trouble to find the precise time when we became friends.</p>
