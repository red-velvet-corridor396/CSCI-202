                <p>My earliest memories of heavy metal were from car rides with my mom. I don't consider
                    this time
                    period "the beginning" of my interest in metal; rather, I see it as just the context in which my
                    interest was allowed to take root. But it shows that even early on, I had a particular fondness of
                    metal. I've always been drawn to it. My mom and younger brother all listened to music on my parents'
                    iPod (which is ancient, by the way--one of the older models). The music varied a fair amount, but it
                    was mostly popular music (rock, hip-hop/rap, pop, etc.) from the 70's to the 2000's (but mostly the
                    90's and 2000's). And of course, what Gen Xer's library would be complete without Metallica?
                    Specifically, it was the "Garage Inc." compilation that found its way into our rotation. As soon as
                    I heard Metallica's cover of the Queen track "Stone Cold Crazy," I was hooked. (I also I had no idea
                    it was a cover until much, much later.)</p>

                <img class="img left" src="images/ipod.jpg" alt="">

                <p>Sometimes, as a treat, my mom would let the next track, "So
                    What?" play next, and I got to hear the opening "SO FUCKING WHAT!" in all of its obscene glory.
                    (Note: I was no older than 10 or 11.) At that age I didn't quite have the vocabulary to say I liked
                    distorted guitars and dudes with long, greasy hair shouting about things, so I dubbed this genre
                    "angry music." If I wanted to listen to Metallica, I would ask my mom to put on some "angry music."
                    Interestingly, I don't recall hearing any other Metallica songs, or any other thrash bands for that
                    matter, and at one point my mom opted instead to introduce me to Fiona Apple. Her music was
                    certainly angry, but not quite what I was after. I still liked "Fast As You Can" though.</p>
                <div class="clear"></div>
                <img class="img right" src="images/path.jpg" alt="">
                <p> Fast forward to around 2019. I've only just started to actually listen to music on my own and
                    develop my own taste. At the time, my primary vehicle of music discovery was....."meme song"
                    compilations on YouTube. These videos have long since been DMCA'd, but they introduced me to such
                    classics as "Stayin' Alive" by The Bee Gees, or "Rasputin" by Boney M. I also found a lot of music
                    from movies/TV shows (especially South Park, actually) and video games, and my rotation inherited
                    some artists from my parents' iPod as well (namely, Gorillaz). At this point I spent quite a lot of
                    time online, in groups brought together by particular fandoms (for me, this started in about 2016).
                    In one of these groups, I befriended a guy named Brandon, and he put me onto Korn's "The Path of
                    Totality."</p>
                <p>And so my nu metal phase began. I listened to a fair amount of EDM at the time, so the
                    dubstep elements appealed to me, and, being Korn and all, the album spoke to my overblown teen
                    angst. In due
                    time, I explored other records from Korn's discography, as well as bands like Marilyn Manson, Limp
                    Bizkit, System of a Down, and a handful of songs from Disturbed and Slipknot. I also checked out
                    "Kill 'Em All," "Ride the Lightning," and "Master of Puppets" around this time. Sometime in 2020, I
                    watched South Park Season 21 Episode 6, "Sons a Witches," and one scene in particular featured the
                    classic Iron Maiden track, "The Number of the Beast." I loved it. Shortly after, I checked out some
                    other Iron Maiden songs on my own, and "Fear of the Dark" also became a favorite track of mine.
                    There are a few reasons I consider this era as merely preliminary to my interest in metal: none of
                    these nu metal bands (nor Metallica or Iron Maiden) are the bands that spurred me to sincerely
                    explore metal as a whole, and the rest of my interest in metal has been fairly continuous, while
                    these two eras are more separated, and their consequences on my music taste as a whole aren't as
                    obvious.</p>

                <img src="images/mu.png" alt="" class="img right">
                <p>For my senior year of high school, I transferred to another high school in a nearby town (and across the state border!) looking for a fresh start and better educational opportunities. For the most part, I got those things, but I got another very important thing from my tenure at TDHS. It was there that I let metal into my heart. Sorry, Jesus, you'll have to wait in line. It was fall 2022 now, and my music taste had certainly come a long way in the last 5 years. At this time I frequented 4chan's music board, /mu/, and I found a lot of great music via the Essential Charts on 4chan's music wiki and RateYourMusic.com. The former especially would be highly instrumental in helping me get into metal. As soon as I found something I liked, and that I wanted more of, I could simply check those charts and find more right away. That made it easy for me to find a handful of bands I liked rather than just the one. And I could do this quickly. My only real limitation was the rate at which I actually do listen to new music; I tend to do it rather slowly, especially now that the dust has settled and the excitement of an entire genre being new to me has subsided.</p>
                <p class="clear">So, how did this actually start? I struggle a lot to make friends, so around October I asked my mom for some advice, and she suggested complimenting people's shirts (assuming the shirts are of something that I also like, obviously). Not long after, I got the chance to do just that. In my Spanish class I was seated at a table with a guy named Oliver, and eventually I saw him wearing a System of a Down shirt. If I recall, I actually didn't say anything about it the first time. Either I didn't get the chance or I was too shy--likely some combination of both. So I waited a while for him to show up wearing the shirt again. It took a while, but eventually he did, and I told him it was a cool shirt. We may have talked briefly and then parted ways, but I believe we actually became friends when he handed me a note after class at a later date. It had some contact information that I used to hit him up later, and on October 28th, I made my first friend at TDHS. The exact date isn't important, but I'm including it for posterity because I went through a lot of trouble to find the precise time when we became friends.</p>
                <img src="images/acidbath.jpg" alt="" class="img left">
                <p>My obsession with heavy metal can be traced back to exactly one song. That song was from one of Oliver's playlists. We had exchanged Spotify accounts and did some fun stuff like make a collaborative playlist, and I ended up looking at his other public playlists. One song in particular caught my attention, because it had an album cover I recognized from numerous /mu/ charts (and probably some posts, too). That was none other than Acid Bath's "When The Kite String Pops." The track that caught my attention was "Scream of the Butterfly;" I decided to give it a shot, and I fell in love. But the rest of the album was far more abrasive, and I just couldn't get over all the awful screaming (I think it's fucking awesome now, but at the time I wasn't into it). And so I was obsessed with "Scream of the Butterfly," and to my frustration I just couldn't get into the other songs, although I kept trying. I wanted to love this album. I kept banging my head against the wall, but at the same time I had started scouring the /mu/ wiki, looking for similar albums and getting some exposure to the various subgenres of metal.</p>
                <img src="images/sludge_chart.jpg" alt="" class="img right">
                <p>I ended up looking at the "sludge metal" and "doom metal" charts, the latter because it had a "sludge" section on it; this probably helped by encouraging me to try other styles of doom metal as well. I spent a fair amount of time on the "atmospheric sludge metal" chart. By that time I had developed quite a fondness for music that was avant-garde or atmospheric, so some of those atmospheric sludge/doom metal bands really hit the spot. The first was ISIS, particularly their album "Panopticon." That album blew my fucking mind. I also tried "Through Silver in Blood" by Neurosis, but I didn't like it so much. I liked a couple songs though; I remember absolutely loving the drumming at the beginning of the title track. I still wasn't into harsh vocals, and the reason Panopticon worked so well is because they were drowned out in all of the other noise and there were a lot of instrumental sections. I'm confident I would love that Neurosis album if I gave it a shot now, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Two other heavyweights in my heavy new rotation were Ahab's monumental "The Call of the Wretched Seas"--a "funeral doom metal" album that I love to this day--and "The Ties that Blind" from Mouth of the Architect--another atmospheric sludge metal album that definitely holds up as well. I was starting to get used to the vocals, or at least be able to overlook them, and I got really into some of those Acid Bath tracks, namely "The God Machine"--which made it to #9 of my top 10 most listened to tracks in 2023 (I discovered Acid Bath and the rest of these bands throughout December of 2022), "Cassie Eats Cockroaches," and "Jezebel."</p>
                <img src="images/agalloch.jpg" alt="" class="img left">
                <p>While browsing RateYourMusic.com, looking at different metal subgenres, I stumbled upon Agalloch's "The Mantle" and was compelled to try it by some of the reviews. It's still in my top 10 albums. "In The Shadow of Our Pale Companion" was and is a very special track for me, and this was essentially my introduction to black metal--quite a mellowed out type of black metal, but black metal nonetheless. I also checked out Electric Wizard's "Funeralopolis," "Written in Waters" from Ved Buens Ende, "Arcturian" from Arcturus (these two were from an avant-garde black metal chart), Pelican, Woods of Ypres, "Songs of Death" by Put (Russian band), Thergothon, Esoteric, Primordial, and Nails. I still have a review up on RateYourMusic.com for Songs of Death where I complain about the vocals. I should revisit that one too. Finally, I discovered Burzum. Like many others, my first album was "Filosofem." I was also going through the /mu/core chart at this time, so bands like Duster, Radiohead, Don Caballero, GSY!BE, and Queens of the Stone Age were in my rotation alongside Nails and Electric Wizard. My interest in metal was still in its early stages, so in early 2023 my library consisted mostly of other things with some metal sprinkled in there. In the spring I discovered bands like Mgla, Arnaut Pavle, Immortal, and Mayhem. Nails also piqued my interest in grindcore, and with the help of RateYourMusic I dipped my toes into this genre and discovered bands like Pig Destroyer and my beloved Terrorizer. I was also introduced to Nailbomb, Insect Warfare, and Napalm Death, although I never got into these bands as much as Pig Destroyer or Terrorizer. While I can't say for sure, I think it was at this point that I no longer had a problem with harsh vocals.</p>
                <p class="clear">It was in June of 2023 that metal finally usurped the dominant position in my music rotation. I became really interested in black metal, and discovered bands like Darkthrone, Ulver, Paysage D'Hiver, Helleruin, Emperor, Celtic Frost, Venom, Dissection, Mysticum, Bathory, Blasphemy (I actually found out about these guys just by seeing Mayhem's Hellhammer wearing one of their shirts in an old photo), etc. In the midst of all the black metal I was listening to, I also checked out Tomb Mold (only their debut though, I didn't try the rest for some reason), Sulfuric Cautery, Katatonia, Slayer, along with some other bands. I discovered both Mysticum and Katatonia via Darkness Shall Rise Productions. I was really into their cassette box sets at the time. I discovered Tomb Mold and Sulfuric Cautery (along with Arnat Pavle and Helleruin from earlier) through Bandcamp. By now it was the summer, and I was fresh out of high school and just barely an adult. 2022-2023 was a great school year (my favorite out of gradeschool for sure), but the best may be yet to come. </p>
